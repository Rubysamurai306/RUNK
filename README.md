Main repo. RUNK will be made into 2 different versions. 1 minimal for powerusers with minimal overhead inside a terminal, mostly for powerusers or people who want to add more features. and 1 thats fully fledged out with GUI and individual options that can simply be chosen by a checkbox instead of commenting out parts of the script. development has just started so be patient.
support for CachyOS and other Arch derivatives including Arch is main priority for RUNK. Other distros will get support further down the road with proper documentation. be patient. God bless.
